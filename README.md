## About This Project

Welcome to my Selenium WebDriver practice repository! This project represents my hands-on learning experience during **Sprint 8** of my QA Engineering bootcamp, where I dove deep into web automation testing using Python and Selenium.

This repository contains practical exercises and real-world examples that demonstrate my growing expertise in automating web browser interactions, validating web applications, and building robust test frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

During this sprint, I focused on **practical Selenium automation**, including:

- ✅ Setting up Selenium WebDriver with Python
- ✅ Using different **element locator strategies**:
  - `ID`, `NAME`, `CLASS_NAME`
  - `CSS Selectors`
  - `XPath`
- ✅ Working with **explicit waits** (`WebDriverWait` & Expected Conditions)
- ✅ Interacting with web elements:
  - Clicking buttons
  - Sending text to input fields
  - Uploading images / links
- ✅ Validating UI behavior with **assertions**
- ✅ Handling dynamic content and avoiding flaky tests
- ✅ Writing clean, readable, and well-commented test scripts
